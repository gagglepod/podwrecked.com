## What did we learn?

- YOU are your own gatekeeper and YOU are the only one holding your podcast and podcast experiments back.
- Always be creating because the only thing worse than a podcast that doesn't work is not doing one at all.
- Push yourself to become comfortable with being uncomfortable if you want to improve your podcasting skills.
- Continuous creation and experimentation are important to your podcast journey.
- You need to try new things in podcasting to keep yourself from getting bored or stale.
- We go down a brief comic book podcast road when Tim crosses DC with Marvel in a LIVE experiment.
- We even get into Veteran Coffee Roasters because we love coffee and know what good coffee tastes like.

## Podcast Experiments

Turn your podcast idea into something that is _Not Easily Squished!_

### Obviously Avant-Garde

Timothy Kimo Brien, an accomplished artist with over 20 years of experience in the fine arts and poetry world, is experimenting with audio, sound, voice, and silence to bring you a listening experience unlike any other.

### Three Minute Joe

When veterans from an elite military counter-terrorism unit retire and open a coffee shop, they can't fully espresso their excitement enough! However, just when they think their retirement will be nothing but dark roast and easy days, their long list of enemies decides this is the time to get their revenge and finish these real American heroes off once and for all. Can the owners of Three-Minute Joe fend off a rogue's gallery of villains while brewing the perfect cappuccino? Find out in this new audio drama dark comedy, written and directed by Kyle M. Bondo.

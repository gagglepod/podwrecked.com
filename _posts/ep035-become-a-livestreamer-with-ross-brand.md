- We get into the challenges livestreaming can create for people new to video.
- Ross talks about the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920" target="_blank">Logitech c920 as a good starter web camera</a>.

## Quotes

_"A big mistake new livestreamers make is thinking they need to remove the microphone from view because you can't see the microphone on TV. However, livestreaming not TV. Livestreaming is more like radio ON TV, not TV"_<br />

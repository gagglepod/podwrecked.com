Podwrecked Ep.018

## Episode #018

- We translate eight different podcasting languages and try to make them easy for anyone to understand.
- Did we do that?
- You tell us!

## What did we learn?

1. DAW or not to DAW?
2. Interview questions that matter
3. The "Pick-Your-Brain over Coffee" free masterclass request
4. The "This show is not for me" 1 Star listener
5. Podcaster jargon (LUFS, Heil PR-40, ID3) questions in Facebook
6. Paid hosting versus Free hosting
7. Hey, Bra! I just uploaded and got 10,000 downloads! Is that normal?
8. It Depends... Length... Format... Gear... There are no right answers, only wrong answers!

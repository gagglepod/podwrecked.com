Podwrecked Ep.014

## Episode #014

- We talk about the top three categories that have the most shows.
- This leads to talking about why some categories are at the bottom of the list.
- We then move into talking about the podcasts that produce the most episodes.
- We finish off the show by talking about why your primary category is a factor in podcast discovery.

## What did we learn?

- The number one category in Apple Podcasts iTunes Directory is _Religion and Spirituality: Christianity_.
- Choose a category that your audience will think your podcast is in, not the category you think works best for you.
- The categories with the most podcasts are also producing the most content per show.
- The categories at the bottom may not be crowded because there is not much demand for their content. - However, they may also represent opportunities to dominate an underserved niche.
- Many of the categories that have both the most podcasts and the most episodes per show are producing daily podcasts.
- Just because a podcast category is crowded doesn't mean they are good shows nor does it mean they are all current shows either.
- Your category helps your audience find you, but it is your content that keeps them listening regardless of how many shows there are.

## Quotes

_"You may say, 'Well, dragons don't exist.' It's, like, yes they do - the category 'predator' and the category 'dragon' are the same category. It absolutely exists. It's a superordinate category. It exists absolutely more than anything else. In fact, it really exists."_<br />
**― Jordan Peterson**

_"Categories are rarely permanent, and most important work is done by people who don't easily fit in."_<br />
**― Seth Godin**

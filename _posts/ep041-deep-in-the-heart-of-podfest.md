Podwrecked Ep.041

## Episode #041

- We come to you LIVE from Podfest Global Summit 2020, which was 100 percent virtual and hilarious!
- Only hours after we recorded this episode, Chris Krimitsos announced that they had broken the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS record for the _Largest Attendance for a Virtual Podcasting Conference in One Week (5,000+)_! How's that for timing?!
- Tim and Kyle get into the experience we've had over the past week.

## What did we learn?

- Tim shares how virtual events involve time zones and you can now meet people from other countries.
- Kyle talks about how he likes the virtual better... and that he needs a hug.
- Tim explores how different people are online and attending from their homes.
- We get into how virtual connection makes people more vulnerable or feel safe because they can come and go at will.
- Kyle gets into how to sift through the massive amount of content or try to pick between information tracks.
- Tim and Kyle explain the "un-conference" conference and how virtual applications can recreate the hallway-track experience.
- Tim talks about mini-cons and how Podfest has become more than just a single-topic conference.
- Tim teases out that Libsyn.com will be releasing a new interface called _Libsyn 5_ and their upcoming Beta Test.
- Tim is looking forward to Libsyn.com swag that may include a chocolate microphone one day.
- Kyle asks you to go to <a href="https://schoolofpodcasting.com/" target="_blank">schoolofpodcasting.com</a> and ask Dave Jackson to be your coach as part of our help _"Dave's Moving Expenses"_ non-campaign campaign drive.
- We know that our show will come out right as Podfest Global Summit is ending but you can still get a ticket to watch all the videos AND be a part of the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title until August 16th, 2020.
- Kyle gives listener Cliff a very personal "Call To Action" based on lessons learned from Podfest Global Conference.
- Tim and Kyle share how podcasting is a common ground that makes very different people friends.
- Kyle has a "Yoda-Kyle" moment and Tim thinks it needs to be a new segment of the show.
- Tim makes not one, not two, but THREE predictions after attending this conference for a week (see below).
- Because of all the predictions, Tim is now Tim _"POD-stradamus"_ Brien!

## Behind the Scenes

- After we recorded this episode, we lost Tim's side of the conversation!
- This is where Kyle learned that <a href="https://squadcast.fm" target="_blank">Squadcast.fm</a> can recover web recordings using their "backup" feature.
- They are not pretty and the audio is completely out-of-sync... but it is better than having to re-record everything.
- Working with un-synced audio is very painful, but so is losing it all. So remember this: Two is one and one is none.
- **Always have a backup** ... _and now you know!_

## Episode #021

- Dave helps us understand why creating hundreds of episodes and millions of minutes of audio is the secret to becoming better at podcasting.
- We discuss strategies for surviving that "Big Oops" after you hit publish on an episode.
- We tell you what happens when you overwrite your audio file versus reposting your fixed episode.

## Special Guest

## What did we learn?

- There are a lot of ways to help you mitigate the damage of those mistakes.
- You CAN recover from a bad episode.
- Publishing an episode that did not include your voice.
- Publishing an episode that only plays one of two voices on the recording.
- Interviews - Didn't hit record.
- Interviewee that fell asleep.
- Cut and Paste from an old episode and publish the wrong one.
- Don't listen with the ears of a podcaster but with the ears of a listener.
- You can go overkill on recording gear.
- You can go overkill on the number of audio file version saves.
- Hoarding audio files for "just in case" is a real thing that all podcasters do.
- The bare minimum for podcasting gear should be enough for a new podcaster to "get by" -- this means settling for a $60 microphone instead of going out and buying the AKG C-24 that was used in Pitch Perfect 3. (Pro Tip: The AKG C-24 is a collectors microphone for the low low price of $9K).
- Some gear is just weird (with 10 feet of cable) and we just have to live with it.
- Be careful when you name your podcast the same as a _podwrecked_ podcast.
- Subscribe to your show with Apple Podcasts/Overcast (on iPhone), and PocketCasts/Castbox (on Android) to know when your episode goes live.
- Google Play Music is NOT Google Podcasts - they are two separate things!
  Not many people will want you to remove content from an interview (or remove a snippet).
- Always ask in an interview "Is there anything in this interview you don't want out in the world?"
- A single episode marked "Explicit" will drop you out of a lot of other countries unless you're not interested in having an audience in those countries.
- When it comes to audio obsessions, remember that some folks in your audience are listening in the shower.
- Kyle thinks that Dave will one day soon create a podcast devoted to his Crazy Morning Zoo Crew <a href="http://binkyandthewiz.com/" target="_blank">Binky and the Wiz</a>! This is a group of characters Dave introduced in <a href="http://schoolofpodcasting.com/defining-your-mission-episode-400-celebration-theater-of-the-mind/"  target="_blank">School of Podcasting (SOP)</a> Episode #400 and then resurfaced again in <a href="http://schoolofpodcasting.com/episode-not-podcasting-ask-dave-anything/"  target="_blank">SOP Episode #600</a>.
- If you want to hear a special promo Dave did exclusively for Podwrecked, please listen to the very end of the episode!
- PLEASE contact Dave and tell him you want this in the world

## Questions to ask yourself if you Podwreck:

- How long has the episode been out to the world?
- How many people already have this episode?
- Do I want everyone to get the corrected episode?
- Do I care enough to put a re-post in my feed?
- How long do you want to wait for Apple Podcasts to update from my change?
- Did anyone even notice there was a problem?

## Elegant Solutions Notes:

- If you don't care about Spotify and Google Play Music, you can repost with the exact named file.
- Everyone who already downloaded it now has the "collectors edition" of that episode.
- You can repost the audio file with the same name and just not worry about those who already have it.
- You can post a NEW audio file and not worry about your subscribers getting a second version of the first file.
- Apple Podcasts will show the new post but not remove the old one because it is only a mirror of your own feed.
- It may take up to 24 hours to show any changes in the Apple Listing because it is only a snapshot of what is going on with your podcast in 24 hours (not minute-by-minute).
- Apple Podcasts may never remove the listing of the first listing of your changed episode.

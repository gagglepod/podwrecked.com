Podwrecked Ep.008

## Episode #008

- We explore the rise in True Crime podcasts
- We ask the question, "What is the difference between a journalist, reporter, commentator, and podcaster?"
- We talk about the thinking behind how and why podcasters need the same ethical education and standards as journalists

## What did we learn?

- Podcasters should take a serious look at Ethical Storytelling and Reporting standards
- Anyone producing a podcast about news, true crime, or non-fiction should obtain press credentials
- We think that True Crime podcasters should start networking themselves together for safety and credibility.

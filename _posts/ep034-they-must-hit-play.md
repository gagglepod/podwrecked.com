Podwrecked Ep.034

## Episode #034

- We read an article about Podcast Discovery Stats in 2020.
- Kyle focuses on how these stats point out the importance of description and episode titles.
- Tim focuses on how these stats point out the importance of timing and intro hooks.

## What did we learn?

- If listeners don't like the cut of your episode titles they will bounce.
- Listeners DO make judgments about your podcast based on its description BEFORE they hit play.
- If listeners don't get hooks within 5 - 15 minutes they will bounce.
- Listeners WILL hit STOP and DROP your podcast if you don't communicate what your show is about in the first few minutes.
- Tim talks about <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/" target="_blank">National Poetry Writers Month (NaPoWriMo)</a> and how getting out of your comfort zone and writing poetry is good for creativity.
- Listen to the very end to hear Tim and Kyle get "The Sillies" and try very hard to recover from them!

## Episode #045

- We talk about the reasons you might have for ending a podcast
- We get into the need to remove distractions
- We explore why moving past old creations makes room for new creative endeavors.

## What did we learn?

- Tim talks about why he had to close out _KDOI Podcasting_ to make room for _Create Art Podcast (CAP)_.
- Kyle gets into the reasons for closing his podfaded podcast _Podfader_ (irony intended).
- Tim gets Kyle to reveal his struggle in letting go of two podcasts that he hasn't worked on in years: _Merchants of Dirt_ and _Get Lost Racing_.
- While on Tim's couch, Kyle explores the reasons WHY he has been paying to keep these two podcasts alive and essentially being a contributor to the podwreck phenomenon.
- Tim gets Kyle to agree that letting go of these podcasts on December 31st, 2020, will be a good thing!

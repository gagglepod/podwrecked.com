Podwrecked Ep.009

## Episode #009

- We talk about Google's June 2018 announcement of their stand-alone podcasting app launch.
- We do some thinking on why 55 percent of all US users and 86 percent of the world are on phones with the Android OS, but Google Podcasts only account for only 0.9 percent of total listens. Why?

## What did we learn?

- The biggest complaint about Google Podcasts is that it's an app and not native to Android OS like Apple Podcasts is to iOS.
- Even if someone DOES download the app, does the app have everything you want in a podcast-listening application? Only for those who don't know what podcasting is
- Not everyone is in the Google Ecosystem... Yet! Google Podcasts is all about connecting people to Google Assistant and having a podcast player they can use in the car.
- This is not an attempt by Google to put your favorite podcast app out of business. This is Google's on-ramp to podcasting if you've never listened to podcasts before.
- This is Google's slow move toward the future where they move past directories and jump straight into audio indexing. Checkmate!

## Quotes

**-- Daniel J. Lewis**

_"The new podcast app is but one tiny piece of a much grander goal."_<br />
**-- JR Raphael**

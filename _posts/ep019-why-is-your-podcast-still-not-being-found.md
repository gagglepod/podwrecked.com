Podwrecked Ep.019

## Episode #019

- We celebrate our second year of doing _Virginia Podcaster's Association (VAPODA)_ meetups at Germanna Community College!
- VAPODA becomes our new platform for teaching podcasting to podcast newbies
- We explore what happens when we looked up a new podcaster's podcast using PocketCast - We learn that different podcasts can have the same name!
- We throw Friend of the Show _Mathew Passy_ a whole lot of love!
- The Word of the Day is _"conversating"_ (Triple-Word Scrabble Score)
- Introducing _"Tim the Podcast Optimizer"_

## What did we learn?

- Welcome to _Podcast Discovery Optimization (PDO)_
- This is the "What does my website look like on other browsers?" song.
- Followed by the "What does my website look like on other phones?" It's the B-side sleeper hit.
- Now, it's "What does my podcast look like on all apps?"... or even the better question: "IS my podcast in all the apps?"
- You have to look up your podcast because you can't fix what you don't know!
- We thought a podcast name needed to be unique. Nope! Turns out you can have the EXACT SAME NAME in Apple Podcasts (iTunes)! We didn't know that was possible
- We find out that not all podcasting statistics are created equal and not all hosts let you know where your listeners are coming from.
- We know that not all hosts use IAB Standards but when you mix downloads with streaming with listens we can see why newbies get confused
- We learn that Tim has never seen _Game of Thrones_!

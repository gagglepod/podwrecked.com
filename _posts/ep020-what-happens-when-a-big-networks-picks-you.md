## Episode #020

- We talk about why there is a lot of chaotic movement going on between big podcast networks that some see as a _podcasting bubble_.
- Only we looked up the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2013/07/24/what-is-a-bubble/#1e3518ace648" target="_blank">definition of "bubble"</a> and disagree.
- We see a trend where when a big podcast network loses star players they start searching to supplement their content losses.
- We explore how the same behavior happens in all other media too: movie studios, TV networks, radio stations, and now _podcasting!_
- We discuss why networks constantly poach other companies' star players with better deals and creative opportunities.
- We get into the risks involved with signing on to an unstable network and why you need to be wary of their actual motives and their demands on your content.

## What did we learn?

- Big podcast networks are going to be constantly changing, buying new content, and trying to one-up each other.
- When these big podcast networks lose content creators, they will need to fill the void with something new -- this could mean you and your show.
- Think of having a big podcast network interested in your contact like being called up in Major League Baseball.
- It's exciting to have your creation called up from the podcasting _"Minor Leagues_" to the podcasting _"Big Leagues"_.
- Having a big podcast network pick your show for _"The Big Show"_ could be the best thing that ever happened to you and your podcast.
- However, a big network could also put restrictions and creative limitations on your podcast.
- If you get the call, you need to be wary of the demands they will have on your content.

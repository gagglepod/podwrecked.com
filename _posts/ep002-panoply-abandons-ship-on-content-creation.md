Podwrecked Ep.002

## Episode #002

- We talk about how the word _panoply_ is impossible to say and mispronounce it approximately 50+ times
- We explore why Panoply -- the company -- fired all their podcast staff
- We come up with some conspiracy theories of how and why Malcolm Gladwell is leaving Panoply
- We give our perspectives on what we think the iHeartRadio acquisition of _Stuff Media_ means

## What did we learn?

- Don't let something get too big that if it were to end or walk away it would destroy your entire podcast
- Know what your weaknesses are so that you can work on getting them stronger
- Learn from Malcome Gladwell and brand yourself as a content creator (e.g. books, podcasts, talks)
- Diversify by not letting yourself become one-dimensional by only focusing on one thing (e.g. books, podcasts, talks)

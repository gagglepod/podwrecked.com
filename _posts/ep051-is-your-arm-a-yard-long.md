Podwrecked Ep.051

## Episode #051

- We explore metrics and find examples of what each one could mean in real life.
- We get sidetracked and start talking about voiceovers and voice acting.

## What did we learn?

- Tim has been researching metrics that matter and compares that to the size of a ship's sail (hanging from the yardarm)
- Kyle goes on a tangent about starting a Voice Over Acting portfolio
- Kyle and Tim give <a href="https://voiceoversandvocals.com" target="_blank">Jodi Krangle from Voice Overs and Vocals</a> a shout-out!

## We think up some metrics that do matter

- Total Download numbers
- Times you've been emailed by your audience
- Times you've been sought out by your audience in real life
- Times you've been recognized by your podcast peers
- Amount of money made from your podcast
- Number of audience members that use your promo codes
- Number of audience members that click on your special links
- Number of audience members that leave a rating and review
- Times you've been asked to speak at a conference
- Times you've had your voice recognized in public

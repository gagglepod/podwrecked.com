Podwrecked Ep.026

## Episode #026

- Recorded Live at the Howell Branch Library in Fredericksburg during the Virginia Podcasters Association (VAPODA.org) Meetup.
- Tim and Kyle have been experimenting with how to produce a live show
- Nate and Preston attended our October 2019 Meetup to see how the secret sauce is made
- We recorded this BEFORE DC Podfest (dcpodfest.com) where Kyle attended for the 4th year and Tim for the 3rd Year!
- We spent an hour setting up our gear
- We think that coil rolling of audio cables is a lost art
- We go through what gear we use to take our podcast "LIVE"

## What did we learn?

- Live includes a lot of improvs and you have to be good on your feet (or mouth)
- Location can cause problems with sound (e.g. echo, room size, power, lighting)Soundproofing on-the-fly can work but it does not completely remove microphone bleed.
- Our microphones were air-gapped and the audio files used the double-header technique where we each record our own audio file and they are synced together in post-production.
- Kyle is using the ZOOM H4N Pro and an Audio-Technia ATR2100 microphone.
- Tim is using the ZOOM H5 (just to be bigger) and a Samson Q2U microphone.
- Headphones help you hear your sound and hitting record on a portable recorder can make or break your live recording.

Podwrecked Ep.025

## Episode #025

- We discuss how U.S. podcast audiences have grown to 62 million listening weekly.
- We notice that for the first time, more than half (51 percent) of the U.S. population has listened to a podcast, up from 44 percent last year.
- We marvel at how over 144 million people, or 20 million more people than just a year ago, have listened to a podcast.
- We ask with all these people now listening, what are you doing to make sure they are listening to YOU?
- Kyle conducts a master class in content creation

## What did we learn?

- Finding your Ideal Listener: When you figure out your topic, it leads you to online sources. Online sources lead you to people interested in that topic. These people? They are your potential future listeners.
- Define Your Ideal Listener: Refine your ideal audience thinking down to some specific details.
- Find Your Flock: Where there are two or more people interested in something, you can find something built around it (e.g. books, magazines, blogs, websites)
- Sort Your Flocks: When you find a flock, evaluate each flock by lurking with a purpose and learning up-to-the-minute dialog about your flocks.
- Expanding the Search: Choose active or recent discussions, statements, articles, or posts that best represent a point of view about your topic.
- Qualifying your Sources: Content Walking - Active issues, complaints, controversies, problems, and interesting points of view you find.
- Bird Watching with Purpose: Once you start reviewing, searching, collecting and visiting these flocks, the hope is that you will continue to revisit them over and over again until it becomes a habit.
- Go Do the Work: At one point you have to just take what you have and start podcasting so that you can learn what your audience likes and doesn't like.

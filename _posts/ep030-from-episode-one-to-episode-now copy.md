Podwrecked Ep.030

## Episode #030

- We go back and listen to all our first episodes
- There were a few surprises along the way
- We celebrate our first Patreon subscriber Cliff from Glockaholics Anonymous!

## What did we learn?

- That we did intros that were way too long back then
- We fell in love with our theme music in the beginning but go over it after a few years
- We did a lot of experimentation and think that experimenting with your podcast is what keeps it interesting
- Kyle announces that _"time wounds all heals"_, which Tim translates into meaning that you _"do get better with time"_.

## Supporter Shout-Out

## Quotes

_"When we create something, we think, ‘Will our customers thank us for this?’ I think it’s important for all of us to be thinking about whatever marketing we’re creating; is it really useful to our customers? Will they thank us for it? I think if you think of things through that lens, it just clarifies what you’re doing in such a simple, elegant way."_<br />
**― Ann Handley**

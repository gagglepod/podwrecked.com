Podwrecked Ep.013

## Episode #013

- We talk about the three principles of naming a podcast
- We explore the things that mess every podcaster up when they get to name their show.
- We talk about how limiting Apple Podcasts search is right now and how that won't last forever.

## What did we learn?

- Be original, allow for growth, and don't be too abstract.
- Pick a name - You can always change it later.
- Do the work of trying to find a good name because it is the first thing your potential audience sees.
- Google wasn't Google until it _WAS_ Google - which means don't stress too much over this process.
- You may get known for your podcast so make sure your name is something you can live with for a while.
- Do the _Bar Test_ and the _Friends and Family Test_ for every name you experiment with.
- You can always change your podcasts name later, or better yet, start a new one.

## Quotes

_"Who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping. Thus to Ged, who had lost faith in himself, Vetch had given him that gift that only a friend can give, the proof of unshaken, unshakeable trust."_<br />
**â€• Ursula K. Le Guin, A Wizard of Earthsea**

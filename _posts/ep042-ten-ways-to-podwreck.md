## Join us at Indie Podcast Conference 6 (ICON6)

<a href="https://www.indiepodcasters.com/indie-podcast-conference-6/" target="_blank">Indie Podcast Conference 6 (ICON6)</a> was originally going to be held at the Holiday Inn Philadelphia South-Swedesboro on September 24-26, 2020. Due to COVID-19, we have decided to push the next hotel event to September 9-11, 2021 at the same Holiday Inn. ICON 6 will be held in a private Zoom room on September 12-13, 2020, to allow attendees to have face-to-face interaction and host powerful workshops. ICON6 also invites you to dress up in your favorite 80's attire to help lighten the mood and direct our attention away from the pandemic. There will be 80's themed music, trivia questions, and more!

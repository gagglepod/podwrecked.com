Podwrecked | Life is too short for bad podcasts!

Howdy! We are Kyle Bondo and Timothy Kimo Brien, the co-hosts of _Podwrecked_, where we teach new podcasters how to navigate the ebb and flow of the podcast industry.

We are also the co-founders of _Gagglepod,_ a podcast education company that is encouraging a new generation of podcasters to express themselves through podcasting.

We want to help streamline the end-to-end podcasting process and make it easier for people to not only start a podcast but keep podcasting.

And we're going to do this by giving new podcasters the essential tools needed to create a successful show. Why? Because _life is too short for bad podcasts!â„¢_

So please join us on our weekly podcast Podwrecked!

And for more information about how we're changing the way new podcasters design their shows, find us at <a href="https://podwrecked.com" target="_blank">podwrecked.com</a>!

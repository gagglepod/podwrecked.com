## Episode #031

- We welcome <a href="https://www.thepodcastconsultant.com/about-me" target="_blank">Mathew Passy</a> to the show
- Mathew drops knowledge on Tim and Kyle the whole show
- We go into the details surrounding podcast feed hijacking (i.e. castjacking)
- Tim talks about how his new podcast feed for Create Art Podcast on Google Podcasts was castjacked by an Indian company called "HubHopper"
- Get a bunch of podcasters together and we start to talk about all sorts of podcasting issues... like Apple Podcasts
- Mathew gives us his Podcast Migration Strategy 101 and debunks the myth that podcasts don't leave their media host (spoiler alert - they do!)
- Mathew answers the $10,000 question: Does IAB certification matter when picking a podcast media hosting company?
- PSA: Be a good steward of your own show! Check your feeds... and now you know!

## What did we learn?

- You need to check your podcast feeds at least once a quarter
- The only way to protect yourself from castjackers is to know when it's happened to you
- Your podcast media host might not be much help if it happens to you
- Not all castjacking events are malicious but all cases do impact your statistics
- Castjacking is yet another area of podcasting where even lawyers are not sure what to do just yet

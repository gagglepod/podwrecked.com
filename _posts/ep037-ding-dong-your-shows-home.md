Podwrecked Ep.037

## Episode #037

- We discuss why every podcast needs a home website
- We get into why finding an available Top Level Domain (TLD) is tough
- We talk about obtaining brand maturity and how it must be part of a growing podcast
- We share the truth behind how starting small and improving over time works

## What did we learn?

- All of the good domain names are taken or owned by cybersquatters
- Creative domain name suffixes, spellings, or _DOT something else_ can be good alternatives
- Easy to spell, say, or even remember is important
- Your podcast show name, website name, and email address should all align
- Brands, websites, and emails can all be out of sync at first, but you can improve them over time
- Tim missed out on doing something with "Myopic Cyber-Squatters DOT COM"

Podwrecked Ep.010

## Episode #010

- We experiment with recording our podcast from a local coffee shop and discover that people like to ask questions when you put microphones on the table.
- We dig into the data within Dan Misener's article that supports why the podcasting long game strategy is STILL TRUE!
- We explore what behaviors are causing so many podflashes, podfades, and podwrecks.

## What did we learn?

- There is no such thing as an overnight podcasting hit.
- Shows that have big audiences tend to do "these things" and how "these things" are all about common sense.
- Podcasters that do not stick with podcasting for at least 2-years do not have hit shows.
- Producing at least 100 episodes is the milestone to becoming a podcaster - you haven't even begun podcasting until you hit episode 100 (for one podcast or multiple).
- All the things that are hard in podcasting are still hard, but if you overcome them you have a good chance of gaining an audience.

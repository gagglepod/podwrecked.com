## Episode #038

- We welcome Super Joe Pardo (<a href="http://superjoepardo.com/" target="_blank">superjoepardo.com</a>) to the show
- We talk with Joe about how building anything -- including events -- is tough!
- We talk with Joe about how everything you build virtually will take time
- Joe helps us understand how relationships are _everything_ in building _anything_

## What did we learn?

- You're going to be hit in the face more times than you expect - it's what you do after you get hit that counts.
- Everything starts small. Everything is a marathon. Everything!
- Goals take time to mature - don't give up and don't rush them.
- Getting the reps in will get you through the parts you are struggling with.
- Making relationships is vital to success.
- Never phone it in -- You never know who is listening or who will show up to hear you.
- Treat people well -- The connections you make now could be with people who can help you grow later.
- Knowing what you want is a huge advantage.
- Super Joe Pardo comes with his own theme music and sound effects.

## Episode #040

- Kyle interviews Tim using the _Nine Steps Back to Podcasting_.
- We discuss the differences between pausing your podcast, podfading your podcast, and podwrecking your podcast.
- Tim goes deep into his challenges with producing _Clearly Obtuse_ and how he plans to get back on track.

## What did we learn?

- Step 1 — Acceptance: Acceptance is Step One of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to ask yourself to admit that your podcast is worth working on or let it podfade.
- Step 2 — Humility: Humility is Step Two of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to believe that you don’t know everything about podcasting.
- Step 3 — Clarity: Clarity is Step Three of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to get real and honest feedback about your podcast if you are ever going to improve it.
- Step 4 — Insight: Insight is Step Four of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to take an honest look at your podcast and prioritize what you need to fix or improve.
- Step 5 — Commit: Committing to your podcast requires you to get disciplined about your goals if you have any chance of guarding against distractions.
- Step 6 — Focus: Focus is Step Six of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to rebuild your motivation and find your hunger for podcasting before you can truly get back to podcasting.
- Step 7 — Reflection: Reflection is Step Seven of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting and requires you to earn your right to be podcasting by first doing the work, celebrating your wins, and then getting to stay podcasting by never forgetting what you have endured to get here.
- Step 8 — Fellowship: Fellowship is Step Eight of the Nine Steps Back to Podcasting asks you to go find other podcasters, learn about their journey, and discover that you are not alone.
- Step 9 — Mentorship: It’s time to actively give back what you have learned to the podcasting community and become the mentor that keeps other podcasters from podfading.

## Quotes

_"Some podcasts need to be 'podburied'. Not the lessons you learned from doing that podcast, just the podcast itself. Podcasts come and go but the lessons are the critical part of the podcasting journey."_<br />

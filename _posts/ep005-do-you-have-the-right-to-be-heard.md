Podwrecked Ep.005

## Episode #005

- You have a right to free speech, but you don't have a right to be heard
- We talk about deplatforming content based on what you find disagreeable who gets to decide what is disagreeable

## What did we learn?

- Podcasting is one of the last mediums for truly free speech
- _Hate Speech_ is hard to define
- If you host podcasts you need to be upfront about your _Terms of Service_.
- To keep it fair, if you start banning content on the so-called "Alt-Right", then you have to start banning content on the so-called "Alt-Left" too. But who decides? No one knows.
- The solution to hate speech in podcasting is _MORE SPEECH_, not less
- Nobody is listening to these garbage podcasts anyway, so stop giving them more attention

Podwrecked Ep.012

## Episode #012

- We talk about _Podcasting Live_ both as a location idea and in front of an audience.
- We explore the challenges and pitfalls that can befall a live performance.
- We talk about our own experiences both recording a live show and seeing other podcasters record live shows.

## What did we learn?

- A live show is like going to a real play or concert.
- Seeing your favorite podcasters live is not always what you expect but is like meeting your heroes.
- Your podcast heroes are very approachable.
- Live podcast performance is true fan service and makes you very relatable to your tribe.
- Share our experience seeing Radiotopia and Congressional Dish recording their episodes live.
- Live shows give you automatic, first-hand feedback that you can only get from.

## About

### Greetings!

Welcome to Podwrecked! The podcast that helps you Survive Your Show!

Podwrecked is dedicated to helping you survive your podcast. We work through all the challenges that podcasters struggle with and find creative ways to move forward in your podcasting journey.

Join your hosts Timothy Kimo Brien and Kyle Bondo as they navigate the uncharted dangers of podcasting and guide you to safer harbors. What you learn will save your podcast!

### Old Show Art circa 2018-2022

Podwrecked’s original show art was based on a World War II-era poster by E. Oliver titled “Salvage saves Shipping”. Printed sometime between 1939 and 1946, this poster art was modified to show the lifeboat captain carrying the microphone lantern, the ship flying the RSS flag, and the name “podcast” emblazoned across its stern.

### New Show Art for 2023!

We have new show art for our 2023 relaunch! The new Podwrecked show art is a simplified homage to our original poster-based design. We kept the sinking ship, microphone lantern, and lifeboats. However, we simplified the color palette and added the iceberg to represent the real difficulty podcasters have with surviving their podcast. Adding Oncetold to our existing PODWRECKED typography was the final touch to let everyone know we have changed hosting companies to Oncetold.

## Trends

### What is going on in Big Podcast?

In every episode, Tim and Kyle talk about trends within the Podcast Industrial Complex (PIC). Then, at the end of each year, we go back through our list and see how we did.

Most of these trends (i.e. predictions) happen to come true.

However, to keep track of our success, we’ve compiled a list of all our predictions into a list for you to judge for yourself!

Review of Predictions Made in 2020: [Who Had Pandemic On Their Bingo Card? (Episode #47)](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep048-the-future-is-nigh)

### Predictions for 2019

1. We believe that we will reach Podwrecked Episode #50 before 2020 (by EOD on December 31st, 2019) ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
2. We think that more low-budget and/or free podcasting media hosting companies will go out of business in 2019 and that the entire free hosting space business model will come to an end ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
3. We do think Google will double down on Audio Indexing in 2019, making audio content like podcasts searchable for the first time. It won’t be pretty, but it will get better in time and become part of their overall search tool (Episode #7]()).
4. We don’t think Google will start caring about podcasting to the point that will threaten Apple’s market share in 2019 ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
5. We think there will be some new directory offerings that will start to threaten Apple’s podcast directory market share in 2019 ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
6. We don’t think Apple will start caring about podcasting again, at least enough to fix the poor search experience built into iTunes in 2019 ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
7. We think that there will be an explosion of political podcasts that will be established to produce content about the Presidential Primaries in 2019, with a few surviving to become the go-to podcasts for the 2020 Presidential Election ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
8. We think there will be so many short-form podcasts that new Short-Form Podcast Directories will start popping up for those that like bite-sized podcasts for their daily fix or smart speaker briefings ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
9. We think Big News (e.g. CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, CNN, BBC) will go all in with daily and weekly podcasts in 2019. We think there will be so many daily news podcasts that we will be overwhelmed by all the content ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
10. We think there will be an explosion of short-form podcasts (i.e. daily podcasts) that will take advantage of smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Flash Briefings ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
11. We think that the podcast technology-feeding frenzy has yet to start. We don’t think big companies will start buying little podcasting content companies to help them jump into the podcasting space just yet. It will be quiet in 2019… but maybe not for 2020 ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
12. Every Podcasting Host that charges money will be IAB certified in 2019. It will be the new standard for all upcoming podcast hosts that want to enter the industry ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).
13. Podcasting will not go mainstream in 2019 but it will continue to develop — there are just too many other distractions that grab attention to allow podcasting “mainstream” — because 1. delivery, 2. people who know how or what podcasting is, 3. newbies getting into podcasting. Measurement is 75% of people know what a podcast is and knows what a podcast is. Listen once a month ([Episode #7](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep007-shiny-shiny-crystal-ball-of-podcasting)).

### Predictions for 2019

1. Amazon will jump into the podcasting space in 2019 ([Episode #1](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep001-can-amazon-wreck-havoc-on-podcasting))
2. Companies that invest in podcasting content creation will own the space in 2019 ([Episode #2](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep002-panoply-abandons-ship-on-content-creation)).
3. Companies that invest in podcasting content creation will own the space in 2019 ([Episode #3](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep003-to-pay-or-not-to-pay-for-podcasts)).
4. The topic of proper podcast length will still be hotly debated in 2019 ([Episode #4](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep004-your-podcast-is-as-long-as-it-takes-and-no-longer)).
5. We are going to see more deplatforming of podcasts in 2019 ([Episode #5](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep005-do-you-have-the-right-to-be-heard)).
6. We are going to see an explosion of educational-based podcasts and resources designed for the classroom in 2019 ([Episode #6](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep006-does-your-teacher-have-a-podcast)).
7. Teaching educators how to podcast will lead the way to the first creation of a new kind of university system in 2019 ([Episode #6](https://podwrecked.com/trends/ep006-does-your-teacher-have-a-podcast)).
